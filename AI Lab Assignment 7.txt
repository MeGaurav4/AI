# **AI Lab – Assignment 7**

## **Implement Forward Chaining Algorithm**

---

# **1. Theory (Crisp & Simple)**

Forward chaining is a **data-driven inference technique** used in rule-based expert systems.

### **How it works:**

1. Start with a set of **known facts**.
2. Look for rules where **all conditions are satisfied**.
3. Infer new facts (add conclusions).
4. Repeat until **no new facts** can be derived.

This is essentially:
**IF conditions ⟶ THEN conclusion → add conclusion to facts → repeat.**

### **Where it is used**

* Expert systems
* Medical diagnosis engines
* Production rule systems
* Knowledge-based agents

Your implementation uses:

* Rules of form `{conditions} → conclusion`
* A loop that keeps inferring until nothing new is added

# **2. Pseudocode (Short + Fully Covers Logic)**

### **Forward Chaining Algorithm**

```
facts = initial facts
repeat:
    newFactInferred = false
    for each rule in rule-base:
        if all conditions of rule are in facts
           AND conclusion not in facts:
               add conclusion to facts
               print inference
               newFactInferred = true
until newFactInferred == false
return facts
```

### **Check All Conditions**

```
allConditionsTrue(rule.conditions, facts):
    for each condition:
        if condition not in facts:
            return false
    return true
```

# **3. Real-Life Case Studies (Actual Applications, Not Analogies)**

---

## **Case Study 1: Medical Diagnosis Expert System**

In hospital triage systems:

Rules like:

```
IF fever AND cough → suspect_infection  
IF suspect_infection AND low_oxygen → admit_patient  
```

Forward chaining starts with patient symptoms and repeatedly infers new medical states until diagnosis is reached.

---

## **Case Study 2: Fraud Detection in Banking**

Banks use rule-based inference such as:

```
IF unusual_login AND high_transaction → flagged_account  
IF flagged_account → freeze_card  
```

Facts come from transaction logs.
Forward chaining detects risky behavior in real time.

---

## **Case Study 3: Smart Home Automation**

Smart homes use rules like:

```
IF motion AND night → turn_on_lights  
IF window_open AND AC_on → alert_energy_loss  
```

As sensors generate facts, new actions are inferred automatically.

---

## **Case Study 4: Agriculture Expert System**

Crop advisory systems use:

```
IF soil_dry AND temperature_high → increase_irrigation  
IF pest_detected → spray_insecticide  
```

Farming decisions are automated based on real sensor data.

# **4. Test Cases**

### **Test Case 1 (Given in your code)**

Rules:

```
A & B → C  
C & D → E  
E → F  
```

Initial facts:

```
A, B, D
```

Expected inference steps:

```
Inferred: C
Inferred: E
Inferred: F
Final facts: A B D C E F
```

---

### **Test Case 2 — No new facts**

Rules:

```
A → B
B → C
```

Initial facts:

```
X
```

Expected:

```
Final facts: X
(No inference)
```

---

### **Test Case 3 — Single rule, single condition**

```
Rule: {Rain} → WetRoad
Facts: {Rain}
```

Expected:

```
Inferred: WetRoad
Final facts: Rain WetRoad
```

---

### **Test Case 4 — Cyclic rules**

```
A → B
B → A
```

Initial facts:

```
A
```

Expected:

```
Inferred: B
Final facts: A B
(No infinite loop, since duplicates not re-added)
```

---

### **Test Case 5 — Large chain**

```
A → B
B → C
C → D
D → E
```

Initial facts:

```
A
```

Expected:

```
Inferred: B
Inferred: C
Inferred: D
Inferred: E
```

---

# **5. Optional Viva Q&A**

### **Q1: Forward vs Backward chaining?**

* **Forward**: data-driven, starts from facts, moves toward conclusions
* **Backward**: goal-driven, starts from goal, works backward to verify

### **Q2: Where is forward chaining preferred?**

When you have **lots of data** and need to infer all possible consequences.

### **Q3: What happens if two rules infer the same fact?**

Only inferred once (duplicate check).

### **Q4: How do we prevent infinite loops?**

By storing facts in a set — repeated facts are ignored.

### **Q5: Is this algorithm complete?**

Yes — if a fact can be inferred through available rules, forward chaining will find it.

### **Q6: Complexity?**

Worst-case exponential if rules are large, but typically linear in number of rules × number of iterations.

### **Q7: Can forward chaining derive contradictory conclusions?**

If rules are inconsistent, yes. Rule engineering must avoid contradictions.
