# **AI Lab – Assignment 9**

## **Create a Chatbot Application for Any Real-World Scenario**

Let’s build a **simple Rule-Based Restaurant Assistant Chatbot** in C++.
It answers basic customer queries about menu items, timings, and reservations.

# **1. Theory (Short & Crisp)**

A **chatbot** is a conversational software agent that interacts with users using predefined rules, patterns, or AI models.

This assignment uses a **rule-based chatbot**:

* Pattern matching on keywords
* Responds with predefined answers
* No ML needed
* Easy to implement in C++

Real-world chatbots use:

* NLP
* Knowledge graphs
* Intent classification
* Dialogue state tracking

But for lab purposes, a rule-based system is perfect.

# **2. Pseudocode**

```
loop:
    read user input
    if input contains "menu": print menu info
    else if input contains "time": print opening hours
    else if input contains "reserve": print reservation steps
    else if input contains "bye": exit
    else print "I didn't understand"
```

# **3. Real-Life Case Study (Actual Use)**

### **Restaurant Customer Support Chatbot**

Used in:

* Zomato
* Swiggy
* Domino’s
* McDonald’s kiosks

It answers questions like:

* “What’s on the menu?”
* “Are you open now?”
* “How do I book a table?”
* “Do you deliver to my location?”

Your implementation mimics an early stage version of such a chatbot.
